- If a creature with the Blood Fortitude trait drops to 0 hit points, it drops to 1 hit points instead. This consumes 300 ml of stored [[Cybernetics/Body Parts/Blood]]. This can be prevented by any of the following:
	- The damage is fire or radiant damage.
	- The creature does not have enough stored [[Cybernetics/Body Parts/Blood]] to cover the cost.
	- The damage is from a critical hit.
