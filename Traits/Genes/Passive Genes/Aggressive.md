- **Effects:**
	- Carriers of this gene are quick to anger, anytime the carrier fails a skill check, misses with a melee attack, or takes psychic damage, they must make a DC 15 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they gain 1 level of [[Anger]]. On a success, nothing happens. 
	- This gene is disabled while the carrier is in a [[Berserk Rage]].
