- **[[Metabolic Efficiency]]:**
	- 12
- **Effects:**
	- Carriers of this gene can store blood in a special gland, up to 1000mL of (non-hemogenic) blood at one time. 
	- Carriers of this gene lose 250mL of blood from storage every day.
		- If they do not have enough blood to cover the 250mL of blood loss they will suffer from 1 level of [[Exhaustion]]. 
		- Every day they do not cover this blood cost will incur an additional level of [[Exhaustion]]. 
		- The [[Exhaustion]] may be remedied by having an extra 250mL of blood in storage (on top of the 250mL needed by default).
	- Carriers of this gene have [[Hemogenic Blood]]
