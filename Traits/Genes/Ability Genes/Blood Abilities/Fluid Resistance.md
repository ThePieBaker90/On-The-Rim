	- If a carrier of this gene takes damage, as a reaction, they may expend 200 ml of stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]] to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 turn.  
	- This cannot occur if any of the following are true:
		- The carrier has a vulnerability to the damage type.
		- The carrier does not have enough stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]] to cover the cost.
		- The damage is from a critical hit.
