- **Effects:**
	- Carriers of this gene gain the Animalfeed action. This action may only be taken on animals. This does not inherently give the carrier blood storage
		- Animalfeed - 1 Action
			- You attempt to bite a nearby creature to drain them of their blood, make a melee roll to hit against the creature. On a hit you deal 1d6 + STR piercing damage, drain 500 mL of [[Body/Humanoid Body Parts/Blood|Blood]] from the target, and gain 500 mL of [[Materials/Blood|Blood]]. If the target is asleep, this attack does not wake them.
