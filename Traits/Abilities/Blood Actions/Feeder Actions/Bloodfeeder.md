- A creature with the bloodfeeder trait gains the bloodfeed action. They may only take blood from non-[[Hemogenic]] humanoids. This trait does not inherently give the creature blood storage.

- Bloodfeed:
	- *Melee Weapon Attack*: STR to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + STR) piercing damage. The user drains 500 mL of blood from the target. If the target is asleep, this attack does not wake them.
