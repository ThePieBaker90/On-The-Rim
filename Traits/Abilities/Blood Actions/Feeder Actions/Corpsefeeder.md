A creature with the corspefeeder trait gains the corpsefeed action. They may only take blood from non-[[Sanguophage]], [[Bruxa]], [[Ekkimian]], or [[Strigoi]] humanoid corpses. This trait does not inherently give the creature blood storage.

Corpsefeed:
Targets a humanoid corpse. The creature drains 500 mL of blood from the corpse. The corpse is drained of all blood and cannot be fed on again.
