A creature with the sanguofeeder trait gains the Sanguofeed action. They may only take blood from [[Sanguophage]] (and its sub-xenotypes) humanoids.

This trait gives the creature 1000 mL of [[Sanguophage Blood]] storage.

Sanguofeed:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: STR to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + STR) piercing damage. The user drains 500 mL of [[Sanguophage Blood]] from the target. If the target is asleep, this attack does not wake them.
