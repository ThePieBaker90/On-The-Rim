A creature with the animalfeeder trait gains the animalfeed action. They may only take blood from animals. This trait does not inherently give the creature blood storage.

Animalfeed:
*Melee Weapon Attack*: STR to hit, reach 5ft, one target. Hit: 4 (1d6 + STR) piercing damage. The user drains 500 mL of blood from the target. If the target is asleep, this attack does not wake them.
