A creature with the sanguofeeder trait gains the sanguofeed action. They may only take blood from [[Sanguophage]] (and its sub-xenotypes) humanoids. This trait does not inherently give the creature blood storage.

Sanguofeed:
Targets a [[Sanguophage]]humanoid corpse. The creature drains 500 mL of blood from the corpse. The corpse is drained of all blood and cannot be fed on again.
