You have proficiency with tinker's tools. Using those tools you can spend 1 hour and 10 credits worth of materials to construct a tiny clockwork device (AC 5, 1 hp). The device ceases to function after 24 hours (unless you spend 1 hour repairing the device to keep it functioning), or when you use your action to dismantle it; at that time you can reclaim the materials used to create it. You can have up to three such devices active at a time. 

When you create a device choose one of the following options
- Clockwork Toy
	- *This toy is a clockwork animal, monster, or person. When placed on the ground, the toy moves 5 feet across the ground on each of your turns in a random direction, It makes noises appropriate to the creature it represents.*
- Fire Starter
	- *The device produces a miniature flame, which you can use to light a candle, torch, or campfire. Using the device requires an action.*
- Music Box
	- *When activated, this device plays a single song at a moderate volume. The device stops playing when it reaches the song's end or is disabled.*
