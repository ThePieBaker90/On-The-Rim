You gain a grimoire called the book of shadows. When you earn this trait choose 3 cantrips from any class's spell list. With this book you can cast those cantrips at will. These spells are considered warlock spells for all relevant effects.

If you lose the book of shadows, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement book. The previous book is destroyed upon completion. If you die, the book of shadows turns to ash.
