- If a creature with the Blood Fortitude trait drops to 0 hit points, it drops to 1 hit points instead. This consumes 300 ml of stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]]. 
- This does not occur if any of the following are true:
	- The creature has a vulnerability to the fatal damage type.
	- The creature does not have enough stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]] to cover the cost.
	- The damage is from a critical hit.
