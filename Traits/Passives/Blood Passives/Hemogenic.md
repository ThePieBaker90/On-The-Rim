- A creature with the Hemogenic trait may store blood in a special gland, up to 1000mL of (non-hemogenic) blood at one time. 
- Every day they lose 250mL from this storage. 
	- If they do not have enough blood to cover the 250mL of blood loss they will suffer from 1 level of exhaustion. 
	- Every day they do not cover this blood cost will incur an additional level of exhaustion. 
	- The exhaustion may be remedied by having an extra 250mL of blood in storage (on top of the 250mL needed by default).
- This creature's blood is considered [[Hemogenic Blood]] (if its blood has not been changed by a cybernetic)
