- If a creature with the Fluid Resistance trait takes damage, as a reaction, they may expend 200 ml of stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]] to gain resistance to that damage type for 1 turn.  
- This cannot occur if any of the following are true:
	- The creature has a vulnerability to the damage type.
	- The creature does not have enough stored [[Materials/Blood|Blood]] to cover the cost.
	- The damage is from a critical hit.
