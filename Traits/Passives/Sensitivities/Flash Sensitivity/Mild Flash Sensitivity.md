- A creature with the Mild Light Sensitivity trait suffers from the following:
	- The [[Flashed]] condition lasts for twice as long
	- When transitioning from darkness to bright light (with no dim light in between), the creature gains [[Flashed]] for 1 turn.
		- This is not doubled by the other part of this trait.
