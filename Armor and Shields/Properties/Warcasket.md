A piece of armor that has the Warcasket property must be installed on the user rather than put on. Once installed, the Warcasket becomes part of the creature’s body and the creature loses their [[Arms]] and [[Legs]]. Arms and legs are not needed when a Warcasket is installed and are “replaced” with 100% [[Efficiency]] parts within the Warcasket.

Speed is reduced by a flat 10ft When a creature has a Warcasket installed, this cannot reduce the creature's speed below 10ft.

When installed, the creature may use Warcasket weapons.
