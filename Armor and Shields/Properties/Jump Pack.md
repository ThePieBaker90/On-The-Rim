A piece of armor that has the jump pack property grants the wearer the ability to jump anywhere within a circle with a 90ft radius. This ability may be used once per short rest for free or be recharged with one tank of [[Chemfuel]].

If the wearer lands on a creature, the wearer may make an opportunity melee attack on the creature.

If the wearer attempts to land on a roofed area or jump while under a roof, they will take 2d4 force damage per entry/exit.
