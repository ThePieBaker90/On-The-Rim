- A creature's germline determines its [[Endogenes]]. A creature's germline is determined at character creation. 
- A creature's germline may not be changed in any way, but they may change their [[Endogenes]] through certain processes.
- All germlines are genetic modifications of [[Human|Baseliners]].
