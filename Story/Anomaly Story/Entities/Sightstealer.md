- **Lore**:
	- *Emaciated and misshapen humanoids. Their arms end in sharp, curled claws formed from [[Bioferrite|bioferrite]]. Sightstealers are fragile, but use psychic influence to render themselves invisible until they get close to their victims. They are known to emit haunting screams as they gather on their terrible hunts.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- A group of Sightstealers (3 or more) may scream dealing 1d8 psychic damage to all non-deaf & non-monstrosities within 120ft of any sightstealer participating in the scream. This scream may only be performed by a sightstealer once every day. This scream does not cost an action to perform.
