- **Lore**:
	- *A large metallic twisting pillar that emanates a putrid psychic energy. The pillar hums ominously and appears to be increasing in activity. It's not clear what will happen when it reaches its full capacity.*
	- *You can attack the pillar to destroy it, but doing so may unleash unnatural and dangerous phenomena.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- The obelisk must be suppressed otherwise it will build up activity. It gains 24% activity every day (1% every hour). 
		- When suppressing the obelisk, the activity reduces by 10% every hour
		- The obelisk takes one person to suppress, it takes the hour to suppress it and they must be touching the obelisk.
		- Every hour that the obelisk is suppressed the suppressor must roll 1d20, if the result is below 20 x The Activity Level (rounded up), the obelisk mutates a random creature within 40ft.
			- For example if the activity level is 50%, the DC would be 10.
	- Upon being damaged, the obelisk gains 15% activity.
	- When at 100% activity, the obelisk explodes mutating one part of every member of the party.
		- The explosion deals 2d12 force damage in a 10ft sphere.
	- When the obelisk mutates a creature, the creature is determined by a dice roll (dependent size). After the creature is chosen another dice roll (1d20) is made to determine which mutation is given. 
		- Mutations can only overwrite natural parts this way. If a mutation is chosen which has no targetable natural part, a new mutation is chosen.
