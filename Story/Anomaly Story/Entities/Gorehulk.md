- **Lore**:
	- *A monstrous creature that resembles a massive, painfully swollen human with randomly reconfigured body parts. Near its top is a stretched face that watches its victim with dead eyes. Hundreds of sharp keratin spines protrude from the gorehulk's skin. It can launch these spines to spear its victims at a distance. However, its awkward fleshy body is less effective at causing harm up close. It's hard to know whether this is a human that was horribly distorted by the influence of the void or a poor imitation of humanity created from scratch by some evil intelligence.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Can be affected by animal exclusive affects (speak with animals, manhunter pulse).
	- Prioritizes getting out of melee range of hostiles at all costs.
