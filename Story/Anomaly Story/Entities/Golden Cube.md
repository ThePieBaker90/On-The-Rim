- **Lore**:
	- *A cube that fits snugly in the hand. Golden in color, it is always invitingly warm to the touch, like a trusted pet or a hug from a good friend. Those that look closely are rewarded for their attention, by the delightful way light plays across its welcoming surface. The cube seems impervious to most damage.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Creatures with any level of [[Cube Obsession]] enjoy being around the cube, playing with the cube, and doing cube related tasks. Creatures without this condition see the cube as mundane and uninteresting.
	- The cube can be studied, to study the cube a creature must succeed at one of the following checks. When a check is passed the corresponding information is revealed to the party. The cube may be studied once per day and failed checks may be retried the next day.
		- DC 15 Investigation (On the cube) - Your investigation reveals that the cube is impervious to all damage.
		- DC 15 Arcana (On the cube) - You have found that the cube is able to psychically influence those nearby.
		- DC 15 Insight (On a cube obsessed creature) - You have found that the creature is not possessed or replaced. They genuinely enjoy the cube.
		- DC 15 Perception (On the cube) - You have found that the cube is not made out of gold but a substance that looks a lot like gold but weighs a lot less.
		- DC 15 Mechanical (On the psychic emanators) - You have found that these were used to create some sort of psychic wave, unfortunately they are broken now.
	- To fully understand the cube and find a way to stop it for good, the party must succeed a total of 3 skill checks. This can be any combination of checks. Each skill check and ability check may only count towards this requirement once.
	- When the cube is fully understood, the party may subdue the cube by repairing the psychic emanators in the [[Facility Anomaly#Golden Cube Containment|Golden Cube Containment]] (with a DC 14 [[Mechanical Skill]] check) and placing the cube in the containment room. This prevents the cube from using the cube affliction action and removes all levels of [[Cube Obsession]] and [[Cube Withdrawal]] from all creatures. If the cube is removed, the cube reactivates.
		- If the party attempts to repair the psychic emanators before fully understanding the cube, the DC is 22.
