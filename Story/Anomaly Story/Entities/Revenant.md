- **Lore**:
	- *A spindly figure of desiccated skin stretched over an impossibly tall humanoid frame. The revenant's name comes from its pattern of returning to hypnotize new people each night.  Outlander folklore describes an invisible specter that captures the minds of sinners, placing them in a living hell. In the story, the victims can only be returned to life by hunting the creature as it sleeps and killing it. A hidden revenant can be revealed with disruptor flares, explosives, or by being lit on fire.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- When defeated, the revenant reverts into a [[Revenant Spine]] which may be destroyed or modified to be a [[Spine]] replacement in a creature. 
		- A creature who has a revenant spine may gain the Psychically Invisible trait. 
		- When destroyed the spine gives the creature who destroyed it an ability score improvement of 2. The creature gets to choose which ability scores are improved. This is permanent.
		- If neither installed or destroyed the spine will regenerate back into a revenant after 48 hours.
