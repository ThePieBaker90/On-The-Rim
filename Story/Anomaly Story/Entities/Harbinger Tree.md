- **Lore**:
	- *A gnarled tree that grows a flesh-like covering. Harbinger trees are capable of feeding on corpses and raw meat, and will consume those placed nearby. If well fed, the grove will continue to grow.*  
	- *In a tribal myth, these trees are the emissaries of a mad, shapeless god who rules an endless black ocean. The myth ends after the shapeless god reaches up from the water and tears down the sky.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Consumes corpses within a 25 ft radius. Each corpse restores 1d10 health for the tree. If it consumes a corpse while at full health the tree will sprout creating 2 harbinger tree saplings nearby. 
	- Harbinger tree saplings grow into full harbinger trees by consuming 1 corpse.
