- **Type**:
	- Phenomena
- **Challenge:**
	- 1
- **Lore**:
	- *A turgid blood-like [[Psychofluid]] that falls from the sky. Anyone exposed to it feels a growing anger that eventually becomes a berserk rage.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- When exposed to blood rain a creature will get melee attack buffs and stacking debuffs eventually resulting in a [[Berserk Rage]].
	- Melee damage impact affects the damage of melee attacks, rounded up.
	- Creatures lose the effects of blood rain if they are sheltered from it at 1 level every 1 minute.
	- Blood rain lasts as long as the associated [[Blood Orb]] remains uncontained.
