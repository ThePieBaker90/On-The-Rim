- **Lore**:
	- *A gargantuan amalgamation of dozens of smaller fleshbeasts linked together by a loosely shared central nervous system. It uses its massive claws to dig tunnels through solid rock. Dreadmelds are rarely seen above ground, instead sheltering in caverns built from living flesh.
- **Anomaly**:
	- Upon death, the dreadmeld bursts into a [[Bulbfreak]]. This [[Bulbfreak]] burst out on the same spot where the dreadmeld died, spawns with the surprised condition, and takes its turn when the dreadmeld would've. The dreadmeld leaves no corpse behind.
	- Upon being damaged to 40 health, 1d4+1 [[Trispike|Trispikes]] + 1d4 [[Toughspike|Toughspikes]] burst out of the dreadmeld up to 10ft away. They spawn with the surprised condition and take their turns immediately after the dreadmeld.
