- **Lore**:
	- *A man-sized amalgamation of several smaller fleshbeasts. Each of the creature's limbs is capable of surviving independently. On death, trispikes may split into separate [[Fingerspike|fingerspikes]] as each limb rips free and attacks.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Upon death, the trispike bursts into 1d4 [[Fingerspike|fingerspikes]]. These [[Fingerspike|fingerspikes]] burst out up to 10ft from where the trispike died, spawn with the surprised condition, and take their turns when the trispike would've. The trispike leaves no corpse behind.
