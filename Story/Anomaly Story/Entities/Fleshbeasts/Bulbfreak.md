- **Lore**:
	- *A horrid oozing amalgamation of many smaller fleshbeasts, all controlled by a linked nervous system. It has two large claws which it uses to tear through its victims. Bulbfreaks are often smelled before they are seen, giving off an overwhelming odor of rancid meat. They are relatively slow and easy to kill, but once they die, they explode into a horde of [[Trispike|trispikes]]*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Upon death, the bulbfreak bursts into 1d4+1 [[Trispike|Trispikes]]. These [[Trispike|Trispikes]] burst out up to 10ft from where the bulbfreak died, spawn with the surprised condition, and take their turns when the bulbfreak would've. The bulbfreak leaves no corpse behind.
