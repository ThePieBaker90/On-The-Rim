- **Lore**:
	- *Corpses reanimated by microscopic [[Archites|archites]]. Shamblers are slow, mindless, and will attack relentlessly. Unless captured, shamblers die from metabolic exhaustion after several hours.*
- **Anomaly**:
	- Shamblers are created whenever a corpse is touched by [[Deadlife Dust]]. Shamblers always have these stats with the exception of size which is dependent on the corpse's size, and health which is dependent on the size of the new shambler.
