## Drawback:
*On the beach a human boy lays, barely alive, as a nearby a ship burns to ash.*

Sergei cannot swim and will drown if submerged in water (unless saved).

At the beginning of every turn while within 30 ft of a large body of water, Sergei must make a DC 12 Wisdom saving throw. Upon failure Sergei becomes frightened of the body of water.
