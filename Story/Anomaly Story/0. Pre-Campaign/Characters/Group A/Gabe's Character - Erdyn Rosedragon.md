## Drawback:
*The guitar is the only thing that matters now and forever.*

Erdyn refuses to use any instrument other than the [[Staticaster]].

Erdyn will routinely play the [[Staticaster]] at inappropriate times.

Erdyn cares about the [[Staticaster]] far more than anything else and refuses to let others touch it.

The psychic presence within the [[Staticaster]] may tell Erdyn to do an action. Erdyn must succeed a DC 14 wisdom saving throw, on a failure Erdyn carries out the action.
