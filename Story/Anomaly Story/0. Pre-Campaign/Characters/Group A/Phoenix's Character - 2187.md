## Appearance:
- 29 Years Old (23 Chronologically)
- Bald
- Blue Skin
- Right Handed
- 8'8"
- Bright Red Eyes
- The caster arm has the name Tillman Radley engraved in common along with the number "2187".
- Wears a custom motorcycle helmet at all times. The helmet is jet black with a screen over the visor which can display information 2187 wants to convey.
- Breath Weapon comes out of the [[Caster Arm]] instead of their face.

********
## Drawback:
*2187 was a slave since they were a child, their body modified with cybernetics against their will. This trauma has caused them to lose the ability to speak and have full control over their spells.*

2187 is permanently silenced, although they can communicate with their custom motorcycle helmet to those who are looking directly at them.

2187 is also a dragonborn, a race which is constantly oppressed.

2187 always rolls a 1 when rolling for a wild magic surge.
