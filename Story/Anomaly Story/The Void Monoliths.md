The void monoliths are the origin of all anomalous phenomena, structures, and creatures. All of these are known collectively as entities. There are two monoliths, one for each party.

The first player character to interact with the monolith will become the "Herald" and receive visions on the whereabouts of the [[Dark Archotech Gem]]s.

Each monolith has 10 slots for [[Dark Archotech Gem]]s. These gems are found by entities and progress the story. Once all 10 are slotted into the monolith the endgame begins and both groups merge.

If the group falls asleep outside of the [[Facility Anomaly|Facility]], they will wake up with all of their belongings in the [[Facility Anomaly|Facility]] barracks

*A monolith of unknown age, purpose, and construction. Its smooth surface is etched with lines that twist and writhe in unsettling patterns.*

All entities fall into 3 categories; Basic, Advanced, and Ultimate.
