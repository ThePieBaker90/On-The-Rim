The facility is the main dungeon that the party will explore in the first part of the campaign. The facility is located on [[Ferroclad]].

The facility was active from September 5th 4602 up until September 5th 4612 when an incident happened which caused the facility to be abandoned.
****
# Exterior
The exterior of the facility is two large [[Plasteel]] security doors (10 ft across) built into the side of a mountain. Next to the doors is a hand scanner which can be hacked by succeeding a DC 15 [[Mechanical Skill]] check. This check only needs to be completed once by each party.

Near the mountain some solar panels can be found covered in overgrowth, these will power the facility if they are cleared off.

Immediately through the doors is a very large elevator (20 ft by 20 ft) which can go to 2 floors, the ground floor (the exterior) and basement 1 (the entrance). The elevator has 2 entrances, the opposite door is used on each floor.
