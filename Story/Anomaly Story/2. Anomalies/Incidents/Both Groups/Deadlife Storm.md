*An old cemetery rots away as corpse-grey clouds begin to roll over the horizon. An aura of death is felt by all nearby. Tonight is going to be a terrible night.*
****
## Setup
The party is located near the monolith and facility. Near these is an old cemetery that looks to be untouched for hundreds of years. There are 18 graves although most are unreadable. The following graves are readable (The graveyard is an illusionist graveyard):
- There is a grave with a large statue dedicated to it, the statue has a plaque that reads Mari the Phantom Bringer 4508-4608. The statue depicts a cloaked human cupping its hands. In the hands of the statue is a large glowing blue stone (a [[Gaulderstone]]). 
- There is a cross headstone with a plaque reading Aleth the Vision Creator 4511-4605.
- There are two graves which share one simple headstone, the headstone is engraved with {{Len and Ren the Twin Tricksters 4580-4611 4580-4610}}.
- There is a simple headstone with an unknown symbol (Translates from infernal to mean "Warrior") along with an unknown name (Translates from infernal to mean Khari the Mirage Maker 4560-4605). Resting on the headstone is an odd knife (the [[Spotted Knife]]).

Corpse-Grey clouds can be seen on the horizon (a [[Death Pall|Death Pall]]). After 1 hour the incident starts and the [[Death Pall]] arrives.
****
## Incident
When the [[Death Pall|Death Pall]] arrives, the air will begin to smell like rotting flesh. Additionally, [[Shambler|Shamblers]] will rise from each of the graves at the graveyard. 
The encounter will consist of:
- 18 [[Shambler|Shamblers]]
While the [[Death Pall|Death Pall]] is going on, the [[Shambler|Shamblers]] will revive one turn after being killed unless they are missing their head. 

The [[Death Pall|Death Pall]] lasts for 10 minutes.

If the party decides to hide in the facility, they will encounter a [[Revenant|Revenant]] who will start out hiding in the dark hallway. This [[Revenant|Revenant]] will drop a [[Revenant Spine]] and a [[Dark Archotech Gem]] when killed.
