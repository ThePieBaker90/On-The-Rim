*Surely the minor tremors are nothing to worry about*
****
## Setup
The party is located near the monolith and facility. [[Harbinger Tree|Harbinger Trees]] can be found sprouting nearby. There is one hole in two of the trees which when reached into grants the [[Fleshglove]] and [[Biological Magazine]]. 

Minor tremors can be felt over the course of an hour, they get stronger as the hour goes on. At the end of the hour the incident starts and [[Fingerspike|Fleshbeasts]] arrive.
****
## Incident
When the [[Fingerspike|Fleshbeasts]] arrive, [[Fingerspike|Fingerspikes]], [[Toughspike|Toughspikes]], and [[Trispike|Trispikes]], ambush the party through underground tunnels. 
The encounter will consist of:
- 12 [[Fingerspike|Fingerspikes]]
- 3 [[Toughspike|Toughspikes]]
- 5 [[Trispike|Trispikes]]
For the next 10 minutes anytime a [[Trispike]] or [[Toughspike]] is defeated, a new [[Fingerspike|Fleshbeast]] of the same type joins the fight through the underground tunnels.

If the party decides to hide in the facility, they will encounter a [[Revenant|Revenant]] who will start out hiding in the dark hallway. This [[Revenant|Revenant]] will drop a [[Revenant Spine]] and a [[Dark Archotech Gem]] when killed.

## Loot

- [[Paul's Notes on the Death Pall]] - Found on a desk in the [[Facility Anomaly|Facility]] in the central room
- [[Revenant Spine]] - Dropped from the [[Revenant|Revenant]]
