#### Ship Crash
All relevant player characters (from both groups) are sent to retrieve supplies and people from a failed research mission on [[AN-5570]], locally known as Erythreos. But as the shuttle approaches the planet, an unexpected failure happens in the shuttle, causing it to crash to the planet below. The party escapes the crashing shuttle via drop pods. The drop pods land on a high island called [[The Crimson Shores]]. The current global time is September 3rd, 5546, current local time is Septober 5th 7829. The current moon phase is a new moon. They crash in the middle of the day although it is currently raining.
