- Cube Obsession is measured in 6 levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of Cube Obsession, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to psychic damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from Cube Obsession and suffers another effect that causes Cube Obsession, its current level of Cube Obsession increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- Cube Obsession does not dissipate on its own, it can only be removed when another effect explicitly removes this condition.
- Modifiers affect all relevant skills as well as saving throws.
