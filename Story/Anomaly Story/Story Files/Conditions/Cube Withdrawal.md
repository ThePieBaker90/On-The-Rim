- Cube Withdrawal is measured in 6 levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of Cube Withdrawal, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to psychic damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from Cube Withdrawal and suffers another effect that causes Cube Withdrawal, its current level of Cube Withdrawal increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- Cube Withdrawal dissipates one level for every hour per [[Cube Obsession]] level a creature has. 
	- For example if a creature has Level 3 [[Cube Obsession]], it would take 3 hours of playing with the cube to remove one level of Cube Withdrawal.
- A creature suffers the effects of its current level of Cube Withdrawal as well as all lower levels.
