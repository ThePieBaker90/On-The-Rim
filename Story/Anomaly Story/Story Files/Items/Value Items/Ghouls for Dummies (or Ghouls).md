A book describing what a [[Ghoul]] is, their traits, their needs, how to create them, and some theories on ghoul cybernetics.

A notable feature of ghouls is their weakness to direct damage done to their [[Dark Archotech Shard|Shard]]. Additionally, the book states that ghouls can remember faces and are usually docile unless left without food for too long.
