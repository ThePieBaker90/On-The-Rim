## *Voidsight Serum*
*I have found that when this is injected into a creature, it suppresses the inhibitory neurons in its eyes that keep perception focused on the real world, thus lifting dark psychic phenomena into conscious perception. The tangible effects of this are an increase to the amount of knowledge gained when studying unnatural entities but the creature's sanity takes a hit.*

## *Juggernaut Serum*
*When injected into a creature, the serum increases their strength and speed, and allows them to recover from injuries faster. Unfortunately they have a harder time performing mental tasks. I'll have to run some tests with our security guards.*

## *Mind-Numb Serum*
*After testing I have found that when this serum is injected into a creature, they enter a state of apathy thus becoming harder to interrogate.*

## *Metalblood Serum*
*I have found that when injected into the bloodstream of a creature, the serum can harden the flesh when it anticipates a blow, making the it more resistant to damage. I have found no downsides to this serum so far.*
