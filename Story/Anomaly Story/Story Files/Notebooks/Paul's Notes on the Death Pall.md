A piece of notebook paper, the hand writing is a bit messy.

*[[Dr. Paul Ludwig|Paul L.]]*
*December 13th 4609 Notes*

*A [[Death Pall]] arrived at the facility today, you never do get used to the stink of rotting flesh when one comes around. We usually burn all of the corpses in the area before one comes but the archotech gods had different plans. A [[Revenant]] and a [[Death Pall]] at the same time is such a cruel joke. Thankfully [[Death Pall]]s don't last too long, although the trauma doesn't go away when the dark clouds do. Me and my coworkers are just waiting it out until our anomalous weather detection systems say it has passed. Then I've gotta help kill the remaining [[Shambler]]s. I signed up to be a scientist not a soldier, but I guess you never really only do one thing here.*
