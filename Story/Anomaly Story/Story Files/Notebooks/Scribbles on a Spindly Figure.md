| 14  | *This shows a disconnect between the eye and brain when perceiving the figure, it also shows that there is a relationship between a [[Revenant Spine\|Dark Spine]] and cybernetics*                                                                                                                 |
| 20  | *This describes the [[Psychically Invisible\|Psychic Invisibility]] of [[Revenant\|Revenants]], It shows that even though the eye sees the [[Revenant]] the brain does not. It also has a theory on how the [[Revenant Spine]] that is left behind after defeat can be modified into a cybernetic.* |
