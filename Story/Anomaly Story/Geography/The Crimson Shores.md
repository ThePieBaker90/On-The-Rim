The crimson shores are a high island with two massive mountain ranges, there are several cities on this island but only one is reachable by the party; [[Ferroclad]]. [[Ferroclad]] is to the south and sits on the cliffs of the nearby ocean. To the east and west of the city are two large mountain ranges. Each mountain range holds an anomalous facility near the monolith. Outside of Ferroclad is some rural farmland along with 2 crash sites. 

The geography is a boreal forest
