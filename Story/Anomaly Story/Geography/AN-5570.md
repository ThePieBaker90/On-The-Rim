AN-5570 (Known locally as Erythreos) is an earth sized planet with high islands scattered around its surface. Due to high amounts of iron on its ocean floor the water from it is red; although it is safe to swim in, it is not safe to drink. Whenever it rains the rain is red, although this red rain is safe to stand in. Due to the red oceans the sky is a pinkish color during the day.

The world is about the same size as earth and follows the same 24-hour day night cycle, although years are only 60 days rather than 365.

Seasons all are of equal length; 15 days. The months also line up with the seasons, months are called quadrums due to there being 4 of them.
