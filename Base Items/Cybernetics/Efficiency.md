- Efficiency affects the stats of a user and can either benefit or hinder natural scores. 
- Efficiency is represented as a percent with no upper cap and a lower cap of 0%. All basic [[Cybernetics]] (along with some special cybernetics) will have a skill/ability score associated with them. That cybernetic's efficiency will affect that skill/ability score. 
- Efficiency is multiplicative. This is important for when 2 or more cybernetics affect a skill or ability score.
- Efficiency affects skills and abilities differently.
	- For skills, such as [[Sight-Based Perception]], you take the ability score that affects it, wisdom in our case, and multiply the score by the efficiency.  The result will be the ability score which is used to determine the skill bonus. If the ability score is in between numbers, round to the nearest number. Additionally this ability score is not limited to 20.
	- For abilities, such as dexterity, you take the ability score itself and multiply it by the efficiency. Then you update all skills which rely on that ability score, sleight of hand and stealth in our case. If the ability score is in between numbers, round to the nearest number. Additionally this ability score is not limited to 20.
- All skills/ability scores which are affected by an implant's efficiency have a modifier which affect the change to the skill from efficiency. To find the result, simply take the increase/decrease the skill/ability score receives from efficiency and multiply it by the corresponding multiplier. That is the new increase/decrease the skill/ability score receives.
