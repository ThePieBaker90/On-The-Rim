The Combat Medic can both fight enemies and administer treatment to allies. This description is ass. Honestly not sure what this class can provide that medkits/stims or smth wouldn't.
Maybe they make them? Like their blood and marrow are hijacked into factories for healing nanites? Healing others can maybe hurt themselves.
