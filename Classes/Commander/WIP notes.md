Commander
- Combat preparedness. Add Int to initiative rolls
- Commanding Presence. Allies within 10ftare granted one of the following bonuses, which can be changed as a free action once on your turn.
* Discipline: +1 to saving throws
* Resolve: +1 to skill checks
* Focus: +1 to hit rolls
* Fury: +1 damage on all attacks
* Fortitude: +1 to AC (was that what we were calling it?)
(these don't necessarily need names but I liked thme)
- Comms unit. Communicate telepathically with any ally of known location. Like message but better I guess. Could be room for more features, woking with CP?
- Command Points. A consumable resources and the main mechanic of the class. Out of combat maximum of 5+int CP. In combat this amount can be exceeded but excess is lost when combat ends. Can do number of Command Actions equal to Int modifier as free actions, and additional as bonus actions.
- Command Actions (and remember I'm ass at names so they could change):
* Tactical Advantage. Add or subtract the roll of a die (only one) to any roll before result. Cost depends on size of die:
D4- 1CP
D6- 2CP
D8- 3CP
D10- 4CP
D12- 5CP
(this has diminishing returns to encourage using them tactically. Though could increase costs by one to make them pretty much linear)
* Tactical Reassesment. Allow an ally to reroll any D20. Must take the second result. 2CP.
* Flexible Coordination. Switch the turn order of two allies for the next round (assuming we don't have flexible initiative which I don't think we did?) 1CP
* Rally. Choose an ally within 30ft (later upgrades to AoE). They ignore the negative effects of one condition (restrictions apply, you know more than I do about all the conditions) until the start of your next turn. The condition is not removed unless by other means! They gain 2D6 temporary hitpoints until the start of your next turn. 3CP.
* Reconnoiter. Select one enemy. Learn one unknown vulnerability and one unknown resistance, if applicable. 1CP or bonus action. 
* Coordinated Effort. Apply passive/ability of one ally to another for this round. This needs balancing work.
* Shared Intelligence. Allow an ally to use your Int modifier on a check instead of their own. (Also saves at higher levels? or other modifiers?) 1CP
* Decisive Moment. Until the beginning of your next turn, all damage is doubled and all rolls are made with advantage for all combatants. 5CP. 
Other:
* Inspire. Select up to CHA modifier number of allies within 15ft (30ft?) that can hear you (unnessecary because comms?). They gain +1D4 temporary HP until the start of your next turn and +1 to their next attack. Gain 1CP per ally affected. Main action. 
CP is refilled up to maximum on long rests. Besides Inspire you can get 1CP (a partial refund basically) from the successful use of some of your abilities:
* For Tactical Advantage- if the added die turns a save/check from a failure to success. Same for hit? Though that's harder to know if it worked or not. For damage, if the target dies before your next turn.
* For Tactical Reassesment- if the new roll is 5+ more than the first one.
* For Rally- if the temporary hitpoints are lost before your next turn (from damage absorbed).
* Decisive Moment- if the combat ends before your next turn.
