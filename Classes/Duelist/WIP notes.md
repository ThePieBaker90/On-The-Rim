***VERY* WIP**
## Duelist
* **Stat Changes:**
	*Medium increase to dex. Small increase to movement speed? Large point buy.
* **Passives:** 
	* +1 to hit and maybe damage buff each turn the same enemy is attacked?
 	* Extra attacks or smth, they attack very rapidly
 	*  Pick one weapon type (e.g. ARs). Advantage with that.
		* Bonuses when enemy is using the same weapon type?
* **Abilities:** 
	* Ability to goad enemy into focussing you? W/ wisdom save?
 		* On fail enemy cannot attack anyone else (so long as you are still alive) next turn, and must attack you if they have LoS. Or something like that. Also gives them disadvantage on their next save against this ability.
	* Smoke screens or some shit to obscure the battlefield and force 1v1s?
	* (IDEA FROM BRYCE!!! okay im high asf rn but this is a cool idea i had in a vc: basically, at one point in the duelist' s levels they get to choose a spell path they have a spell known in, then they get a permanent ability based off of that path. I will design these. This would make duelist a good class for people who want to spell sling (using weapons and spells a shit ton), one example would be a skipmancer spell that would transport them and one opponent to a pocket dimension to fight to the death. They may only leave when the duelist dispells the ability or one of them dies. (or gets knocked out if you are a nerd.))
	* Something similar to lucky points? I think this is a particularly good idea.
		* Refill on some different condition than just rests? Like by dealing a certain amount of damage while receiving none in return?
