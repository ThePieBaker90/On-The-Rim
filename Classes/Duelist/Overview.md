With expert technique and fancy flourishes Duelists are unrivalled in 1v1 engagements. However, they must be careful to avoid being overwhelmed by multiple oppnents.

(IDEA FROM BRYCE!!!
okay im high asf rn but this is a cool idea i had in a vc: basically, at one point in the duelist'
s levels they get to choose a spell path they have a spell known in, then they get a permanent ability based off of that path. I will design these. This would make duelist a good class for people who want to spell sling (using weapons and spells a shit ton), one example would be a skipmancer spell that would transport them and one opponent to a pocket dimension to fight to the death. They may only leave when the duelist dispells the ability or one of them dies. (or gets knocked out if you are a nerd.))
