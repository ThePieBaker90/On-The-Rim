***VERY* WIP**
* **Stat Changes**
 * Large increase in movement speed. Small increase to str, dex. Medium point buy.
* Momentum
  * +movement speed expended/10ft to melee damage
* Hard to hit when moving at speed (Evasion?)
  * -1 to hit per 10ft movement for your attacks, -2 per 10ft for enemy attacks (or just +2EV per 10ft moved)? 
Needs a few more things, maybe.
* Overdrive
 	* Action
 	* For 1 minute:
 		* +50% movement speed
  		* +50% EV
  		* Extra action (or bonus action?)
	* When effect ends:
 		* One level exhaustion
* Dodge:
	* Thrice per long rest (or however we do that):
 	* When attacked, may make dex roll
  	* If result is more than the attack roll, attack is dodged
  	* For attacks that always hit, DC is 20
