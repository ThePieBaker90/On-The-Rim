***VERY* WIP**

* **Stat Changes**
 * Large increase in movement speed. Small increase to str, dex. Medium point buy.

* Momentum
  * +movement speed expended/10ft to melee damage
* Hard to hit when moving at speed (Evasion?)
  * -1 to hit per 10ft movement for your attacks, -2 per 10ft for enemy attacks (or just +2EV per 10ft moved)? 
Needs a few more things, maybe.
