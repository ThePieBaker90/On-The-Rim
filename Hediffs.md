All players will get a hediff sheet. Hediff stands for (H)umanoid (E)quivalent (DIFF)erences. It is used to represent the differences between a humanoid and a perfectly healthy and normal humanoid equivalent.
****
The hediff sheet takes the form of a table with 2 columns and as many rows that are needed. All hediffs that add a flat number should be at the top of the table. All hediffs that rely on efficiency should be under these. The following is an example hediff sheet:
(Assume the character has a 10 in all ability scores)

| Hediff                                         | Effect                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

Hediff sheets don't have to be in the exact wording as above, they can be represented like the following:

| Hediff         | Effect                                                                       |

| Sanguophage    | +2 STR, +4 DEX, +2 CON, +1 INT, +1 WIS, +1 CHA. Gains sanguophage abilities. |
