		- If a creature starts their turn in the area of effect, comes within the area of effect for the first time this turn, or ends their turn within the area of effect, they must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, they take 4d6 electric damage and and 1 random [[Cybernetics|Cybernetic]] they have installed is [[Conditions/Special Conditions/EMP Stunned|EMP Stunned]] for 1 turn. On a success, they take half as much damage.
		- All non-cybernetic or non-EMP-shielded electronics in the area of effect are disabled for 3 turns.
	- If the ball collides with a surface, it sticks to the surface.
