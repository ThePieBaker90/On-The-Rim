- Level 1 Miscast - Instant Evaporate
	- All water within a 45ft sphere centered on the caster instantly evaporates. This does not evaporate mixtures which are not atleast 95% water and mixtures with a boiling point above 100C. 
- Level 2 Miscast - Blanket of Boiling Water
	- A sheet of boiling hot water manifests slightly above the caster, it is a circle with radius of 15ft. After about 2 seconds, the sheet falls, soaking everything under it. Any creature under it must succeed a DC 15 dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 fire damage. The creature also automatically fails any concentration checks resulting because of this damage.
