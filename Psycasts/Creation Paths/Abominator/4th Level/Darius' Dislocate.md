Any creature within the sphere with enough remaining speed to reach the edge of the sphere may make a dexterity saving throw. A creature is teleported on a failed save, or if they don't/can't attempt a save. The creature is moved to the closest edge and are not teleported on a successful one.
	- When teleported, the creature's relation to the point is kept in tact. The ending point's Yaw dimension (normal to the floor) may be rotated.
