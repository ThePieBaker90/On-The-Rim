- **Lore**:
	- *Abominations are golem-like semi-sentient creatures typically made from [[Abomination Matter]]. They will mindlessly take commands from their creator although wild abominations do have a tendency to rebel. Although abominations easily fall apart they can easily reform themselves making them useful for dangerous tasks*
