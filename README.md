The goal of this TTRPG system is a cyberpunk world with fantasy like features. 
An important concept is that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. 
For the most part the universe, including the party, is relatively realistic and grounded in reality.
Please read the core assumptions doc.
