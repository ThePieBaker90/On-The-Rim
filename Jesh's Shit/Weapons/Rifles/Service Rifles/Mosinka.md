- **Lore:**
	- An ancient relic of Pre-Calamity Old Earth, this rifle still miraculously cycles and fires with little issue. Etched into its long-petrified wooden stock is a mysterious inscription in one of Old Earth's many forgotten pre-common languages: "Пуля глупа, штык умен". Affixed to the rifle is a fracutred bayonet, the two fuzed inseperably together after millenium of neglect.
