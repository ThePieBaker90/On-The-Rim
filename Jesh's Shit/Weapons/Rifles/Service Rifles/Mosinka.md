- **Lore:**
	- An ancient relic of Pre-Calamity Old Earth, this rifle still miraculously cycles and fires with little issue. Etched into its long-petrified wooden stock is a mysterious inscription in one of Old Earth's many forgotten pre-common languages: "Пуля глупа, штык умен". Affixed to the rifle is a fracutred bayonet, the two fuzed inseperably together after millenium of neglect.

- **Looks**:
	- A handle made of a light wood which ergonomically curves and terminates in the barrel of a flare gun with a trigger to fire it not too far. Attached to this is the head of a fireman's axe. Overall this has a very impressive build quality, feeling great in the hands.
- **Special**:
	- Can be used as a melee weapon (Fireman's Axe) or ranged weapon ([[Flare Gun]]). 
	- When used as a melee weapon it does not consume any ammunition and does not need ammunition to be used. 
	- The number needed to roll a critical hit while attacking with this weapon is reduced by 1. This effect can stack.
	- If a critical hit is landed while attacking with the melee part of the weapon, the user may expend one piece of loaded ammunition to immediately fire a flare at the creature they just landed a critical hit on. This always hits and benefits from critical hit effects.
