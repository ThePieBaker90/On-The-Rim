	* Damage Roll:
  		* Start with 0 damage.
  		* You may roll 1d10 and add the result to your total.
  		* Repeat this as many times as you'd like.
  		* Once you're satisfied, lock in your damage total.
  		* Then, roll one final 1d10 and add it to the locked total.

    			* Less than 21: You hit- deal that much piercing damage.
