	* The XSG-2 Stinger Micromissile is a compact, lightweight, fire-and-forget underbarrel missile launcher with a dual IIR/MMW seeker. While expensive, it provides effective anti-armour capability in a much smaller package than a dedicated weapon. 
* **Looks**:
	* A small tube, roughly 2in in diameter and 6in long, fitted under the barrel of the gun. A small rectangular protrusion contains optics and fire control systems.
