- **Properties**:
	- I don't know what properties mean exactly yet, to be figured out later
- **Value**:
	- Negligible sale value, except to perhaps a collector or historian.
- **Looks**:
	- A dirty, corroded, Mosin M1891/30 rifle with attached bayonet, broken off at aproximately half length
- **Lore:**
	- An ancient relic of Pre-Calamity Old Earth, this rifle still miraculously cycles and fires with little issue. Etched into its long-petrified wooden stock is a mysterious inscription in one of Old Earth's many forgotten pre-common languages: "Пуля глупа, штык умен". Affixed to the rifle is a fracutred bayonet, the two fuzed inseperably together after millenium of neglect.
