A Weapon with the [Recoil] property has a high recoil. After the first shot, each sucessive shot in an attack action has a cumulative -3 to hit, as shown below.
| Attack | Hit Modifier |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | none |
| 2 | -3 |
| 3 | -6 |
| 4 | -9 |
| 5 | -12 |

On their turn, a character may expend 10ft of movement and take the [Brace] action, reducing each shot's detriment to hit from -3 to -1.
