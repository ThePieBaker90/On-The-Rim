A Weapon with the Mounted property is large and designed to be fired from a fixed mount or vehicle. 
Under ordinary circumstances a Mounted weapon cannot be moved from its mount.
To move a mounted weapon, it must be Dissasembled.
* An assembled Mounted weapon startts with four stages of assembly.
* The weapon may only be fired if it has exactly four stages of assembly.
	* If an action is used to disassemble the wepon, it loses one stage of assembly.
	* If a bonus action is used to disassemble the weapon, the user must make a DC15 Dex or Int check.
 		* On a sucess, the weapon loses one stage of assembly
   		* On a failure, nothing happens
     		* On a crit failure, one stage of assembly is added, up to the maximum of four.
       * Once the weapon's assembly stage reaches zero, it is dissassembled and split into two parts- the weapon itself, and the mount, feed mechanism, ammunition, etc.
	* Both halves of the disassembled weapon may then be carried. Both halves are Encumbering x2.
 * After moving, the weapon must be reassembled, with the two halves within 5ft of each other.
 	* If an action is used to assemble the wepon, it gains one stage of assembly.
	* If a bonus action is used to assemble the weapon, the user must make a DC15 Dex or Int check.
 		* On a sucess, the weapon gains one stage of assembly
   		* On a failure, nothing happens
     		* On a crit failure, one stage of assembly is removed, down to the minimum of zero.
       * Once four stages of assembly are complete, the weapon is completely reassembled at the location of the half containing the mount.
       * The weapon is fully reloaded after assembly.
