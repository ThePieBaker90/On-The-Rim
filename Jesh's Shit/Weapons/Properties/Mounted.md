   			* On a failure, nothing happens
      		* On a crit failure, one stage of assembly is added, up to the maximum of four.
    * Once the weapon's assembly stage reaches zero, it is dissassembled and split into two parts- the weapon itself, and the mount, feed mechanism, ammunition, etc.
	* Both halves of the disassembled weapon may then be carried. Both halves are Encumbering x2.
 	* After moving, the weapon must be reassembled, with the two halves within 5ft of each other.
