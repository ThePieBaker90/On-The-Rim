 	- The RAR Mk I is a unique weapon. Instead of firing conventional bullets, it fires small spin-stabilized rockets. This means that the weapon's muzzle velocity is quite low, but the projectile continues to accelerate for some distance after leaving the barrel. This results in a lightweight and reliable weapon with great power at range, though also a high cost and low accuracy. Its typical usage is with commando and airborne forces. The Compact model is a cut-down one-handed version with a shorter barrel and no stock, creating a form more similar to a pistol than to a rifle.
