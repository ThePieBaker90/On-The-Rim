 	- The RAR Mk I is a unique weapon. Instead of firing conventional bullets, it fires small spin-stabilized rockets. This means that the weapon's muzzle velocity is quite low, but the projectile continues to accelerate for some distance after leaving the barrel. This results in a lightweight and reliable weapon with great power at range, though also a high cost and low accuracy. Its typical usage is with commando and airborne forces. The Marksman model features an extended barrel, fixed stock, and advanced optics for increased accuracy at range.
