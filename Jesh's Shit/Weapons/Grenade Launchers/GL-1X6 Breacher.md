- **Lore**
  - The Bumble Ballistics GL-1X6 "Breacher" is a simple and reliable breach-loaded under-barrel grenade launcher compatible with a variety of weapons. While the lack of dedicated sights makes it less effective than a standalone launcher, its smaller form factor makes it arguably more useful.
