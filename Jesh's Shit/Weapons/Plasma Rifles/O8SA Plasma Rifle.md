*  **Lore**:
	* A powerful plasma rifle with relatively high reliability and range. Use of such plasma weapons is classified as a war crime by galactic convention due to the brutality of the plasma burns they inflict. The O82A still finds use in special forces and insurgent groups in roles where conventional firearms may not be ideal.
