Every creature, vehicle, construct, etc. that can be targetted has an Armour Value (AV) separate from its Armour Class (AC). While the AC describes the difficulty of hitting the target, the AV represents the difficulty of penetrating its protection.
All weapons, ammunition, spells, or anything else that may cause damage has an Armour Penetration value (AP). Some damage sources may ignore armour completely. 
AV/AP ranges on a scale of 0 to 9.

| Armor Value | Example Armor             |
| ----------- | ------------------------- |
| 0           | No Armor                  |
| 1           | Clothing                  |
| 2           | Light Personal Armor      |
| 3           | Medium Personal Armor     |
| 4           | Heavy Personal Armor      |
| 5           | Armored Car               |
| 6           | Mech                      |
| 7           | Armored Personnel Carrier |
| 8           | Infantry Fighting Vehicle |
| 9           | Battle Tank               |


Larger targets may have multiple armour values, for example on front/sides/rear. Larger targets may also have multiple modules of varying AV and AC, destroying which may disable the target in various ways.

When attempting to damage a target with an AV exceeding the source's AP, a decrease to hit rolls is applied due to the difficulty of penetrating the target.
| AV-AP | Effect on hit roll |
| --- | --- |
| â‰¤ 0 | None |
| 1 | -1 |
| 2 | -2 |
| 3 | -4 |
| 4 | -8 |
| 5 | -16 |
| 6 | -32 |
| 7 | -64 |
| 8 | -128 |
| 9 | -256 |

As evident by the rapid increase, it is highly reccomended to use weapons with approximately the required penetration for the target, as penetrating over four armour values higher becomes near impossible.
