On a crit fail to hit, a weapon that uses ammunition gains the [Jammed] condition and cannot be fired. The user may make one attempt at a DC 10 + difficulty modifier (see below) DEX or INT check. On a sucess, the jam may be cleared with a bonus action, removing the [Jammed] condition. On a fail, the jam requires a main action to clear. 
Certain weapons may have the [Unjammable] property and cannot be jammed. Some weapons may have the [Unreliable] property, which increases the maximum roll for a crit fail by the property's level (Unreliable 1 means nat 1-2, Unreliable 2 nat 1-3, etc.)
