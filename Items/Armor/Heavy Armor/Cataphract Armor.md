- **Lore:
	- *A suit of heavy powered armor, built for maximum protection at the cost of mobility. Heavy layered [[Plasteel]]-weave plates with solid ablative coatings stop all but the most well-aimed or powerful attacks. Neuro-memetic assistors prevent the suit's massive weight from immobilizing the wearer entirely, but the suit is still quite cumbersome.*

Disadvantage on stealth checks.
