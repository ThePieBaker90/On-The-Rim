- **Lore:
	- *Originally a suit of [[Trooper Armor]], it has been modified to make greater use of [[Materials/Eltex|Eltex]]-weave in order to improve the performance of psycasters. This comes at the cost of removing interfering armor plating. Because this is a modified suit, armor like this is rare to find.*
