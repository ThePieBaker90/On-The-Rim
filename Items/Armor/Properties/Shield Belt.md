A piece of armor that has the shield belt property blocks all incoming and outgoing ranged attacks. 

An incoming ranged attack is classified as an attack which is targeting the wearer or anyone behind the wearer from the attacker’s perspective. Meanwhile an outgoing ranged attack is any ranged attack that the wearer makes.

The shield belt can block up to half of the wearer’s maximum hp in ranged damage, rounded down (this will be referred to as shield points, or sp).
* Melee attacks are unaffected by the shield belt.
* If the wearer (or shield belt) is hit by an attack which does electric damage (ex: shocking grasp, lightning bolt, witches bolt) then the shield belt's internal generator fails and its sp drops to 0.
* When the sp of a shield belt drops to 0, the belt no longer protects against ranged attacks, if an attack made the shield belt drop to 0 and there is still leftover damage, the leftover damage is negated entirely.

The shield belt’s size is a sphere centered on the character wearing it, the radius of the sphere is exactly the character’s current furthest appendage from their center + 1 inch. This has a maximum of 5ft in radius (10ft in diameter)

The shield belt has an armor value of 1
- This value isn't affected by the armor the user is wearing unless otherwise states.
- This value may be changed by other properties of the shield belt.
