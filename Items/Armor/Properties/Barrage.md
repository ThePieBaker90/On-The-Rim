A piece of armor that has the barrage property grants the wearer the ability to shoot barrage of grenades as an action. After shooting this barrage the user may not fire it again until they reload the armor which takes 1 minute and 10L of [[Chemfuel]]

The barrage covers a 20 ft sphere within 120ft of the user and all creatures inside must make a DC 17 dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d8 force damage on a failed save or half as much on a successful one.
