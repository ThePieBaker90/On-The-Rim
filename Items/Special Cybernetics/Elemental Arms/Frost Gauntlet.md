* Looks:
	* The arm has the style of a gauntlet with silver scales and wooden accents. A white fur lines the connection between the arm and the shoulder. On the back of the hand there is a glowing light blue glyph which translates to "ice". The arm is highly insulated to low temperatures as to not malfunction from its own use. The palm of the hand can produce extremely low temperatures and launch frozen projectiles by freezing syphoned moisture from the air.
