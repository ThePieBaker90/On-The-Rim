- While affixed to your clothing or worn by you, you can cast disguise self at will, although with 3 changes:
	- The duration lasts as long as you have the stone affixed to your clothing or worn. Removing the stone ends the effect.
	- A creature can discern that you are disguised with a successful DC 14 perception check as a free action. This action must be prompted by the creature and will never be prompted by the DM.
	- You cannot disguise non-wearable items.
