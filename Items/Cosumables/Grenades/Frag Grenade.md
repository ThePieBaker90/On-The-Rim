- When used as an action, the user throws the Frag Grenade. All creatures who are in line-of-sight of the grenade and within 20 ft must make a DC 13 dexterity saving throw. On a failed save they take 2d12 force damage, on a successful save they take half as much damage. This consumes the Frag Grenade.
