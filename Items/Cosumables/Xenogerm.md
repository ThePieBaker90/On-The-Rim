- *A self-contained biological organ containing one or more implantable xenogenes. Once implanted inside a host's body, the xenogerm modifies the host's genes, gene expression, and phenotypic development using viruses, hormones, bio-synthesized drugs, and possibly [[Mechanites]]. Depending on the xenogerm, the host will develop any of a wide variety of exotic traits and abilities, transforming them into a different xenotype.
