	- It is a retro-futuristic pipe wrench with a red handle and an atomic symbol etched into the top of it. A spiral antenna, not unlike a Tesla coil, is attached to the head. A switch near the top of the grip is connected to a red wire that is plugged into the bottom of the antenna.
- **Special**:
	- The user may expend a level 4 spell slot to create a teleporter at their current location and at any location they can see (within 300ft). These two teleporters may be teleported between freely by creatures large or smaller. The teleporter has an AC of 10 and 15 health, destroying one teleporter destroys the other.
