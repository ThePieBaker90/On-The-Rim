* **Looks**:
	* A sawed off Remington 870 shotgun with dried bloodstains around the muzzle. There is a small engraving of a poker chip on the right side of the stock. You can feel a faint psychic presence from within.
* **Special:**
	* When reloaded:
		* the DM should draw a playing card from a standard deck for every bullet. This card is added face down into a second deck (called the "bullet deck"). 
	* Anytime the weapon is used one card is drawn from the bullet deck and shown to the players. 
		* If the card's suit is a spade or club (black suit) then the bullet was a blank and no damage is done. The card is then added to the discard pile.
		* If the card's suit is a heart or diamond (red suit) then the bullet was a live round and full damage is done. The card is then added to the discard pile.
			* In effect, this makes every bullet a 50/50 chance of dealing damage.
	* If the bullet was a blank and the gun was aimed at a friendly creature, the user immediately gains 2 actions. 
		* This does not occur if the bullet was a live round or if the shotgun was not pointed at a friendly creature.
	* The discard pile is shuffled into the standard deck once the standard deck is fully expended. If it is expended while cards are being drawn, the discard pile is shuffled back in and the remaining needed cards are drawn from the new deck.
