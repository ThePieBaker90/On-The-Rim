* **Looks**:
	* A OTs-01 Kobalt revolver with a reinforced cylinder and cylinder release. There is a small engraving of a poker chip on the right side of the grip.
* **Special:**
	* The user has a deck (called the "shoot deck") of 6 standard playing cards. 
		* Spade and club cards (black suit) represent an empty casing
		* Heart and diamond cards (red suit) represent a loaded bullet.
	* When reloaded:
		* The user adds heart or diamond cards (red suit) until there is the desired amount in the shoot deck.
		* The user removes spade and club cards (black suit) from the shoot deck until there are exactly 6 cards.
	* The user may spin the cylinder, shuffling the shoot deck, as a free action.
	* When the user shoots:
		* Only after spinning the cylinder:
			* They add 1d4 piercing damage for every spade and club card (black suit) in the shoot deck. 
		* Always:
			* They draw the top card of the shoot deck.
				* If the card is a spade or a club (black suit):
					* The shot deals exactly 0 damage.
				* If the card is a heart or a diamond (red suit):
					* The shot occurs with all relevant modifiers.
			* They remove the drawn card and add a spade or a club (black suit) to the bottom of the deck.
