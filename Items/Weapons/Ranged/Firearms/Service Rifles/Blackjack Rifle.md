* **Special:**
	* When rolling for damage, create a running total, n. n starts at 1d10 (the dm rolls this and keeps it a secret) and the user may add 1d10 to n any amount of times (If they roll the 1d10, they must add it to n, regardless of the result). Then the final value of n is examined and the listed effects occur.
		* n < 21
			* You deal that much damage to your target.
		* n = 21
			* You deal 42 piercing damage and roll on the piercing critical effects table.
		* n > 21
			* The attack deals no damage.
	* Rolling a critical hit does not double damage, instead roll two dice and choose one to add to n.
