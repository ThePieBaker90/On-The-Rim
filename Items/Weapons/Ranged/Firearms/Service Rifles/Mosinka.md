	- A dirty, corroded, Mosin M1891/30 rifle with an attached bayonet.
- **Lore:**
	- An ancient relic of Pre-Calamity old Earth, this rifle still miraculously cycles and fires with little issue. Etched into its long-petrified wooden stock is a mysterious inscription in one of Old Earth's many forgotten pre-common languages: "Пуля глупа, штык умен". Affixed to the rifle is a fractured bayonet, the two fused inseparably together after millennia of neglect.
- **Special**:
	- Once per short rest, as an action, you may move up to your normal movement speed in a straight line towards a target.
	- If you end within melee distance from the target, you may make a melee attack dealing 2d6 + STR piercing damage.
	- On a hit, the target must make a DC 10 + proficiency + STR strength saving throw or be knocked prone.
