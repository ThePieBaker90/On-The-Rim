* **Looks**:
	* It is a versatile assault rifle which has been modified with a mini-burner unit which uses pressurized bioferrite.
* **Special**:
	* Once per short rest, the user may use an action to ignite a 30ft cone in front of them. Each creature within that cone must make a dexterity saving throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
