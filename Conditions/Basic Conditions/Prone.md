  - Condition
---
- When a creature has the prone condition, they suffer the following effects:
	- Their only movement option is to crawl, crawling is half as efficient as normal movement.
	- They have disadvantage on melee attack rolls and ranged attack rolls within 30ft.
	- A melee attack roll within 5ft onto this creature has advantage, otherwise it has disadvantage.
	- They may remove this condition by standing up, spending half of their movement.
