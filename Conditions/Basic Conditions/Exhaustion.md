- Exhaustion is measured in different levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of exhaustion, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- If a creature already suffers from exhaustion and suffers another effect that causes exhaustion, its current level of exhaustion increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- Exhaustion dissipates on its own, 1 level every time the creature rests and is in a healthy state.
- Exhaustion is capped at level 6.
