- When a creature has the duplication sickness condition, they get 1 level of [[Exhaustion]] every day until their [[Duplicant]] (or the original) is killed. 
	- When the [[Duplicant]] or original is killed, all levels of [[Exhaustion]] granted by this effect immediately wear off.
- This condition cannot be removed by effects that do not explicitly remove this condition.
