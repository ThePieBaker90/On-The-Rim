- When a creature has the frozen solid condition they suffer the following effects:
	- They are [[Paralyzed]] in ice, when this ice breaks they lose this condition.
		- The ice has 22 health, and is vulnerable to fire damage.
		- Any attacks directed at the creature will instead damage the ice.
		- If the condition ends before the ice is broken, the ice simply melts.
			- High temperatures halve the duration and cold temperatures double the duration.
