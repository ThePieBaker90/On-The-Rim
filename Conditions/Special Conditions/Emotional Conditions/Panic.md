- Panic is measured in 5 levels.
	- An effect can give a creature up to one level of panic.
	- Constructs and creatures who do not feel emotion are immune to this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from panic and suffers another effect that causes panic, the creature does not suffer from any additional levels of panic, with the exception of effects within panic itself.
- A creature with panic must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw at the beginning of their turn. On a success, they lose 1 level of panic. On a failure, they gain 1 level of panic.
	- A creature may forfeit all actions on their turn to automatically succeed this saving throw.
