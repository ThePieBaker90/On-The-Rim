- When a creature has the Joy condition, they add 2 to the following rolls:
	- Saving throws.
	- Ability checks.
	- Attack Rolls.
- When this creature is damaged, they must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC of this check is equal to 10 or half of the damage of the attack, whichever is higher. On a failure, they lose this condition. On a success, nothing happens.
- Constructs and creatures who do not feel emotion are immune to this condition.
