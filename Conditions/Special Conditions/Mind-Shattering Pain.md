- Mind-Shattering Pain is measured in 8 levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of mind-shattering pain, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who do not feel pain or are immune to psychic damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from mind-shattering pain and suffers another effect that causes mind-shattering pain, its current level of mind-shattering pain increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- Mind-Shattering Pain dissipates on its own, 1 level at the start of the creature's turn if the creature did not gain any levels of Mind-Shattering Pain after the start of their last turn.
- Mind-Shattering Pain is not capped.
