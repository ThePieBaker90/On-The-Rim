- Poison Buildup is measured in different levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of poison buildup, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to poison damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from poison buildup and suffers another effect that causes poison buildup, its current level of poison buildup increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- Poison Buildup dissipates on its own, 1 level every time the creature receives the effects of poison buildup.
- Poison Buildup is not capped.
