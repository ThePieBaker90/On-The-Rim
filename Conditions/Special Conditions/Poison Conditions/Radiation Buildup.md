- Radiation Buildup is measured in 20 levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of Radiation buildup, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to poison damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from Radiation buildup and suffers another effect that causes radiation buildup, its current level of radiation buildup increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- All reductions in maximum health are rounded down if maximum health is not a whole number.
- Radiation Buildup dissipates on its own, 5 levels for a rest.
