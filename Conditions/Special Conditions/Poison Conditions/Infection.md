  - Condition

- Infection is measured in different levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of infection, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to poison damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from infection and suffers another effect that causes infection, the creature does not suffer from any additional levels of infection.
- Infection dissipates on its own, 1 level every time the creature receives the effects of infection.
- Infection is capped at 5 levels.
- When infection is removed (either from naturally dissipating or being cleansed) the creature gains [[Infection Immunity]] for 3 turns.
- When a creature receives damage from infection, every creature within 10ft of them who doesn't have [[Infection]] or [[Infection Immunity]] must make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature gains 5 levels of [[Infection]]. On a success, nothing happens.
