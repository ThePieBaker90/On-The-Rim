- When a creature has the berserk rage condition, they must make a melee attack on the nearest creature on each of their turns. If no creature is within range they must navigate to the nearest creature. They will attack creatures regardless of affiliation. 
- Creatures under this condition cannot use any actions other than melee attacks and dashing.
- If the creature was concentrating on a spell, they dispel their concentration.
