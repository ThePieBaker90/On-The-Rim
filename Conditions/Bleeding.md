- When a creature has the bleeding condition, every turn they will lose 200ml of [[Cybernetics/Body Parts/Blood|Blood]].
- If the creature receives any healing, the bleeding effect is lost. 
- A creature cannot have multiple stacks of bleeding. If another stack is applied to a creature, the creature only is affected by the stack with the longest amount of time left.
- Constructs are immune to bleeding unless otherwise stated.
