- When a [[Humanoid Body|Body Part]] has the EMP Stunned condition, that part provides 0% efficiency and any special effects it has cannot be used.
	- One minute of work on the part with 10 credits worth of materials will remove this condition from the cybernetic. 
	- Prosthetic and Natural parts are immune to this condition.
	- If a part that is necessary to live gains this condition, the user falls unconscious for the duration of the condition.
- When a creature has the EMP stunned condition, that creature is stunned, and any attack that hits the creature is a critical hit if the attacker is within 5 feet of the creature.
	- Non-Construct creatures are immune to this condition (unless otherwise noted, such as mechanoids).
