- When a [[Cybernetics|Cybernetic]] has the EMP Stunned condition, that cybernetic provides 0% efficiency and any special effects it has cannot be used.
- One minute of work on the cybernetic with 10 credits worth of materials will remove this condition from the cybernetic. 
- Prosthetic [[Cybernetics]] are immune to this condition.
- If a part that is necessary to live gains this condition, the user falls unconscious for the duration of the condition.
