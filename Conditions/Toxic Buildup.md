- Toxic Buildup is measured in twenty levels.
	- An effect can give a creature one or more levels of toxic buildup, as specified in the effect’s description. 
	- Creatures who are immune to poison damage are not affected by this condition.
	- If a creature already suffers from toxic buildup and suffers another effect that causes toxic buildup, its current level of toxic buildup increases by the amount specified in the effect’s description.
- All reductions in maximum health are rounded down if maximum health is not a whole number.
- Toxic Buildup dissipates on its own, 1 stack for a short rest & 3 stacks for a long rest. 
	- Toxic Buildup can also be removed by any effect that removes the poisoned condition (unless specified in the effect's description). If removed this way, two stacks of toxic buildup is removed.
	- Greater Restoration can be used to remove 10 stacks of toxic buildup.
