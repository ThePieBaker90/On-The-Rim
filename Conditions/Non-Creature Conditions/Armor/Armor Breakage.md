- Armor Breakage is measured in different levels.
	- An effect can give a piece of armor one or more levels of armor breakage, as specified in the effect's description.
	- If a piece of armor already suffers from armor breakage and suffers another effect that causes armor breakage, its current level of armor breakage increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
- 10 minutes of work on the armor with 5% of the armor's cost worth of materials will remove one level of this condition from the armor.
- Each level of armor breakage reduces the armor's [[Armor Class]] by 1.
- This cannot reduce the armor class of a piece of armor below 0.
