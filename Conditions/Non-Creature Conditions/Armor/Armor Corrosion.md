- Armor Corrosion is measured in different levels.
	- An effect can give a piece of armor one or more levels of armor breakage, as specified in the effect's description.
	- If a piece of armor already suffers from armor corrosion and suffers another effect that causes armor corrosion, its current level of armor corrosion increases by the amount specified in the effect's description.
- Each level of armor corrosion reduces the armor's [[Armor Class]] by 1.
- 10 minutes of work on the armor with 5% of the armor's cost worth of materials will remove one level of this condition from the armor.
- This cannot reduce the armor class of a piece of armor below 0.
