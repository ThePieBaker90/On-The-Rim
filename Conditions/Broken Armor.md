  - Condition

- When a piece of armor has the broken armor condition, that armor's [[Armor Penetration|Armor Value]] is reduced by 2. 
- This cannot reduce the [[Armor Penetration|Armor Value]] of a piece of armor below 0.
- One hour of work on the armor with 10 credits worth of materials will remove this condition from the armor.
