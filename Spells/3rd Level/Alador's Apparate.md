	- [[Abomination Matter]] surrounds the initial point in a sphere with a 15ft radius. Any creature within the sphere with enough remaining speed to reach the edge of the sphere may make a dexterity saving throw. A creature is teleported on a failed save, or if they don't attempt a save. The creature is moved to the closest edge and are not teleported on a successful one.
	- When teleported, the creature's relation to the point is kept in tact. The ending point's Yaw dimension may be rotated.
	- If a creature would end up in another surface, they instead appear at the nearest point not within that surface within LOS. 
	- If a single part of a creature would be teleported, the entire creature is teleported along with it.
