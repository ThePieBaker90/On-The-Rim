The pinnacle of technological development, an archotech is a machine superintelligence that thinks on a level incomprehensible to humans. It wields such enormous power that when constructed, it frequently and quickly is able to assume automatic sovereignty over its world – with its incredible abilities used to expand further and enhance its capabilities through subterranean or even orbital computing facilities. It can even build self-replicating mechanoids to assist in its goals, designing and executing schemes that are beyond human comprehension. They don’t have a consistent appearance or structure, however, each is as indecipherable as the next. They can exist within the internal systems of a space station, or hidden inside a Glitterworld’s internet.

Archotechs, after having subsumed authority over a planet, are known to begin Transcendence – where the world it dominates sees synthetic ascendance. Essentially, altering the planet to become a sort of gigantic computing machine, where its inhabitants are somehow incorporated – or destroyed – sometimes a combination of the two as the Archotech pursues Transcendence. After the process is complete, silence echoes. Forevermore, the motivations of Archotech are unknowable.

However, it is not uncommon to hear about the wrath of Archotechs and Transcendent worlds – those entering their space are lucky to leave unscathed, with some of the more unfortunate travellers never being heard from again. Though, despite these accounts, there are sometimes kinder reports – where allegedly some crew have been cured of diseases thought incurable, or scars that disappeared. Sometimes, those that survived their encounter with the Archotech have their memories intact – in other cases, some are left with amnesia or completely altered memories with suddenly obtained knowledge or even new beliefs.

Though most Transcendent worlds maintain the same state indefinitely – where their inherent stability ensures their continued existence. However, rumors do exist of these worlds having undergone an extinction, where they are left with unintelligible wonders, where any person brave enough to explore these ruins will be able to exploit the untapped wealth that exists.
