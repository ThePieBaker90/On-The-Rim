While held with both hands you have +2 to your spell save DC, +2 to your spell casting modifier, and you do not need to fulfill the somatic or material (except those with a gold value) component of any spells you cast.

The gaulderstone can be used to cast each of the following every 24 hours without consuming a spell slot:
- 2 level 1 spells, you do not need to know the spells, the spells do not need to have your class as a caster.
- 1 level 2 spell, you either need to know the spell or the spell must be one that your class can cast.
- 1 level 3 spell, you need to know the spell.

While holding this you have a -3 modifier to your AC due to how cumbersome the stone is to hold. You may drop the stone as a reaction to an attack to ignore this modifier.

The bonuses granted by the stone do not occur if the stone is not directly held by both hands.
