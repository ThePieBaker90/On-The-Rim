## Gene Overview
- Genes are the building blocks of [[Xenotypes]] and [[Germlines|Germlines]]. The supply the person they are within with various effects. Genes have a form, a type, and a [[Metabolic Efficiency]].
- Genes come in two forms; [[Xenogenes]] and [[Endogenes]].
- Genes come in five categories; [[#Cosmetic Genes]], [[#Life Genes]], [[#Ability Genes]], [[#Passive Genes]], and [[#Skill Genes]].
- Some genes may have specifications, these are listed under the gene and affect the gene in the way listed in its ingo.
- A person cannot have multiple instances of the same gene. Duplicate instances are removed.
## Xenogenes
- See [[Xenogenes]].
## Endogenes
- See [[Endogenes]].
## Cosmetic Genes
- Cosmetic genes determine what a person looks like. Many cosmetic genes have specifications that go along with them. 
	- In [[Germlines]] and [[Xenotypes]] there may be multiple specifications for a cosmetic gene, you choose one of the listed specifications when gaining the [[Xenotypes|Xenotype]] or choosing the [[Germlines|Germline]].
## Life Genes
- Life genes determine certain life traits such as the life span of a person.
## Ability Genes
- Ability genes determine any activated or triggered abilities of a person.
## Passive Genes
- Passive genes determine any passive effects a person has.
## Skill Genes
- Skill genes affect a person's ability scores and proficiencies.
## Metabolic Efficiency
- See [[Metabolic Efficiency]].
## Gene Incompatibility
- Some genes are incompatible with other genes, whichever gene is in the person's [[Xenotypes|Xenotype]] takes priority. 
- Genes can not be added to [[Germlines]] or [[Xenotypes]] with an incompatible gene.
## Obsolete Genes
- Some genes may render other genes obsolete. If a creature has a gene that makes another gene they have obsolete, the obsolete gene is removed. 
	- [[Endogenes]] can make [[Xenogenes]] obsolete.
