## Metabolic Efficiency Overview
- All [[Genes]] have an associated metabolic efficiency. Metabolic efficiency affects a creature's [[Hunger]]. Positive genes take away metabolic efficiency, negative genes give metabolic efficiency.
## Metabolic Efficiency Calculation
- To determine the overall metabolic efficiency of a creature (and therefore how much they need to eat everyday), you simply add the metabolic efficiency of all [[Genes]] they have. 
- For each metabolic efficiency a creature has below -12, they must eat 10% more per day to stay healthy.
	- A creature cannot have less than -24 total metabolic efficiency (Creature must eat an additional 120% food per day)
- For each metabolic efficiency a creature has above 0, they can eat 10% less per day to stay healthy.
	- This can reduce the amount a creature must eat by a maximum of 50%.

| Metabolic Efficiency | Hunger | Metabolic Efficiency | Hunger |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------- | ------ |
| -24                  | 220%   | -15                  | 130%   |
| -23                  | 210%   | -14                  | 120%   |
| -22                  | 200%   | -13                  | 110%   |
| -21                  | 190%   | -12 through 0        | 100%   |
| -20                  | 180%   | 1                    | 90%    |
| -19                  | 170%   | 2                    | 80%    |
| -18                  | 160%   | 3                    | 70%    |
| -17                  | 150%   | 4                    | 60%    |
| -16                  | 140%   | 5 or more            | 50%    |
