When rolling to hit, the attacking creature's controller does the following in order:
- Roll 1d20.
	- Roll an additional 1d20 if the attacking creature has advantage or disadvantage.
- Add all relevant modifiers to the relevant d20 result.
- Compare it to the defending creature's [[Hit Class|Hit Class (HC)]].
	- The attack hits if the result is greater than or equal to the defending creature's hit class.
	- The attack misses if the result is less than the defending creature's hit class.
