## Germline Overview
- Germlines are equivalent to races or species. Germlines are variations on the [[Human]] genome, some are artificial modifications and others are natural mutations brought on by the environment.
- Germlines all have the following parameters: [[#Proportions]], [[#Speed]], [[#Languages]], and [[Endogenes]].
- A person can only have one germline at any given time, germlines also cannot be changed.
## List of Germlines
- [[Demon]]
- [[Drow]]
- [[Dwarf]]
- [[Elf]]
- [[Human]]
- [[Impid]]
- [[Phytokin]]
- [[Witch]]
## Proportions
- The proportions parameter contains two sub-parameters; size, and height. 
	- Size determines a general size of the person with the germline; Tiny, Small, Medium, Large, Huge, and Colossal. Most people have a medium size.
	- Height determines how tall the person with the germline is.
## Speed
- The speed parameter determines the base movement speed of a person with the germline.
## Languages
- The languages parameter determines what languages the person with the germline naturally knows.
## [[Endogenes]]
- The [[Endogenes]] parameter is split into 5 different categories. The [[Endogenes]] held within each category determine what [[Endogenes]] the person with the germline has.
- See [[Genes]] and [[Endogenes]] for more info.
## Half Germlines
- A person whose parents are of different germlines will have parts of both germlines, this person's germline is called a half germline. The [[Endogenes]] and other parameters of half germlines are determined at birth based off of the [[Endogenes]] of both of their parents rather than a preset germline.
- Each parameter of the half germline is determined in the following ways:
	- The size of the child is determined as an average between both parent's sizes.
	- The speed of the child is determined with a coin flip between both parent's speed.
	- The languages of the child are all languages the parents know, up to a maximum of 3.
	- The [[Endogenes]] of the child are determined on an [[Endogenes]] by [[Endogenes]] basis. For each [[Endogenes]] a parent has, flip a coin. On a heads, the child gains the [[Endogenes|Endogene]]. On a tails, the child does not gain the [[Endogenes|Endogene]].
		- If the child were to obtain two instances of the same [[Endogenes|Endogene]], the second instance is removed.
		- If the child were to obtain two conflicting [[Endogenes]], flip a coin to determine which one is removed.
	- The name of their germline follows the syntax "half-{name of parent 1 germline}-half-{name of parent 2 germline}".
- A player character can be a half germline, to determine their [[Endogenes]] and other parameters, determine the parent's germlines. Then use their germlines to determine the player character's half germline.
