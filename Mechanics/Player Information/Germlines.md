## Germline Overview
- Germlines are equivalent to races or species. Germlines are variations on the [[Human]] genome, some are artificial modifications and others are natural mutations brought on by the environment.  
- Germlines all have the following parameters: size, speed, languages, and genes (which are split into cosmetic, life, ability, passive, and skill genes) 
- A person can only have one germline at any given time and germlines can rarely be changed.
