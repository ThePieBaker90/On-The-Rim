Armor piercing (AP) is a number attached to attacks which represents that attack's ability to ignore armor.

For every 1 armor piercing an attack has, the defender's effective [[Armor Class]] is reduced by 1.
- For example, if a defending creature has a base AC of 5 and an attack has a AP of 2, the defending creature's effective AC against that attack would be 3.
