Range is expressed in 3 numbers as opposed to vanilla DnDâ€™s 2 numbers. To use these numbers, consider a target and an attacker. The target is the one being shot at, and the attacker is the one shooting.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is less than the first number (in feet) then the attack is made with disadvantage.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is between the first number and second number (in feet) then the attack is made normally.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is between the second number and third number (in feet) then the attack is made with disadvantage.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is greater than the third number (in feet) then the attack cannot reach.
