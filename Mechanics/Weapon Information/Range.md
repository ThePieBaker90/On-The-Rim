Range is expressed in 3 numbers, the lower-bound, the upper-bound, and the absolute-upper-bound. To use these numbers, consider a target and an attacker. The target is the one being shot at, and the attacker is the one shooting.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is less than the lower-bound then the attack is made with disadvantage.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is between the lower-bound and upper-bound then the attack is made normally.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is between the upper-bound and absolute-upper-bound then the attack is made with disadvantage.
* If the distance between the target and attacker is greater than the absolute-upper-bound then the attack automatically misses.
