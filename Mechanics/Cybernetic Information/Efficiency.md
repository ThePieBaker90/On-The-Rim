## Efficiency Overview
- Efficiency affects the abilities and skills of a user and can either benefit or hinder natural scores. 
	- Efficiency is represented as a percent with no upper cap and a lower cap of 0%. All basic [[Cybernetics]] (along with some special cybernetics) will have a skill/ability score associated with them. That cybernetic's efficiency will affect that skill/ability score. 
	- Efficiency is multiplicative. This is important for when 2 or more cybernetics affect a skill or ability score.
## Effects on Skills and Abilities
- Efficiency affects skills and abilities differently.
	- For skills, such as [[Sight-Based Perception]], any time you make a skill check based on the skill, you multiply the ability score the check is based on with the efficiency for the skill; Wisdom in most cases for this skill. The resulting ability score is then converted into a modifier and added to the roll instead of the standard ability score modifier.
		- If the resulting ability score is in between numbers, round to the nearest number. 
		- The resulting ability score is not limited to 20.
	- For abilities, such as dexterity, you take the ability score itself and multiply it by the efficiency. The resulting ability score replaces the old ability score.
		- If the resulting ability score is in between numbers, round to the nearest number. 
		- The resulting ability score is not limited to 20.
## Efficiency Modifiers
- All skills/ability scores which are affected by an implant's efficiency have a modifier which affect the change to the skill from efficiency. To find the result, simply take the increase/decrease the skill/ability score receives from efficiency and multiply it by the corresponding multiplier. That is the new increase/decrease the skill/ability score receives.
