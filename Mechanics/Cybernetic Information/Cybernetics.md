## Cybernetic Overview
- Cybernetics replace body parts of living creatures in order to enhance their abilities beyond natural limits. They can also be installed to remedy missing limbs or organs.
## Cybernetic Installation
- Cybernetics are installed on creatures (called the patient) by another creature (called the installer) or themselves.
	- If installed by another creature and the installer is experienced in installing cybernetics, the surgeon has advantage on a DC 13 wisdom (medical) check to install the part. 
	- If installed by another player and the installer is not experienced in installing cybernetics, the installer must make a DC 16 wisdom (medical) check to install the part. 
	- If installed by the user, the patient must make a DC 17 wisdom (medical) check and a DC 17 constitution check. 
	- If a wisdom (medical) or constitution check fails, the body part is lost, and the patient must deal with the relevant penalties of having a body part removed
## Cybernetic Restrictions
- Cybernetics only take up one part slot (unless otherwise stated), for example; installing an archotech arm does not replace both arms, only one arm.
	- Cybernetics which do not replace a part may take up a slot on that part (such as enhancers or modules), indicated in parenthesis next to the part.
	- Only one cybernetic may be installed onto a part that takes up that specific slot.
	- Some cybernetics may take up multiple slots or a choice of multiple slots.
