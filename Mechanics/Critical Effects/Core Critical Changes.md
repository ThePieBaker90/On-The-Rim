Anytime a critical success (20) or critical failure (1) is rolled when rolling for hit, in addition to the happenings in base D&D, the instigator should roll the hit location dice and roll on the corresponding damage effect table.

The corresponding damage effect table is determined by the damage type the attack deals. If the attack deals multiple types of damage the following priority table is used:

| Priority | Condition    |
| -------- | ------------ |
| 1        | Most Dice    |
| 2        | Biggest Dice |
| 3        | Listed First |


TODO consider multiple rolls for high damage attacks
