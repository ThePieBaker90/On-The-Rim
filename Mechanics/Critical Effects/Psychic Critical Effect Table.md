| 18-19 | Target has all levels of [[Mind-Shattering Pain]] doubled (maximum of 8 levels), if the target has no [[Mind-Shattering Pain]] levels, they gain 6 levels. |
| 20    | Target gains 10 levels of [[Mind-Shattering Pain]]                                                                                                         |

\*The maximum of 8 levels on rolls 18-19 means that if the doubled levels of [[Mind-Shattering Pain]] would cause the levels to exceed level 8, it instead adds levels until level 8 is achieved.
