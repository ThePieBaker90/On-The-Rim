## Condition Overview
- Conditions are effects that affect a creature. There is no limit to the amount of conditions a creature can have, but most conditions do not stack. 
- All conditions have a duration, although the duration may be indefinite.
- All (non-status) conditions are either positive, negative, or mixed. This determines what effects interact with the condition.
## Statuses
- Statuses are a form of conditions that cannot be removed by most condition removing effects. They can only be removed in the following ways:
	- Effects that explicitly affect statuses.
	- Effects that name the specific status.
	- Effects within the status itself.
- Statuses are neither positive, negative or mixed.
