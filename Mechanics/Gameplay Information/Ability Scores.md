## Ability Score Overview
- Ability scores are a creature's core stats; They measure a creature's physical power, agility, resilience, logic and reasoning, perceptiveness, and ability to engage in diplomacy. Each ability has an ability score associated with it, usually ranging from 5 to 20 but most of the time around 10 and 11. The higher your ability score for an ability, the higher your [[#Ability Modifiers|Ability Modifier]] for that ability.

## Ability Modifiers
- To find the ability modifier from an ability score, subtract 10 from the score and divide the difference by 2 (rounded down). The resulting quotient is the modifier. The following is a table which can be used to easily find the modifier for some common ability scores.

| Ability Score | Ability Modifier | Ability Score | Ability Modifier | Ability Score | Ability Modifier |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1             | -5               | 10-11         | 0                | 20-21         | +5               |
| 2-3           | -4               | 12-13         | +1               | 22-23         | +6               |
| 4-5           | -3               | 14-15         | +2               | 24-25         | +7               |
| 6-7           | -2               | 16-17         | +3               | 26-27         | +8               |
| 8-9           | -1               | 18-19         | +4               | 28-29         | +9               |

## Ability Checks & Saving Throws
- You may be asked to perform an ability check or a saving throw when performing an action. Ability checks and saving throws all have an ability associated with them (Dexterity check, wisdom saving throw, etc.)
	- Ability checks are used to determine the outcome of an uncertain action on the roller's part.
	- Saving throws are used to determine the outcome of an uncertain situation that the roller is in.
- There are some core differences ability checks can be failed at will, can be backed out of before rolling, and may have an associated skill. Saving throws cannot be failed at will, cannot be backed out of, and are limited to abilities. 
- To perform an ability check or saving throw of these you do the following steps in order:
	- Roll 1d20.
		- If you have advantage, roll an additional 1d20 and take the higher result.
	- Add the relevant ability modifier.
	- Add any relevant skill proficiency or expertise.
