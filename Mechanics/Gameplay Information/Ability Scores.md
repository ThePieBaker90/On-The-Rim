## Ability Score Overview
- Ability scores are a creature's core stats; They measure a creature's physical power, agility, resilience, logic and reasoning, perceptiveness, and ability to engage in diplomacy. Each ability has an ability score associated with it, usually ranging from 5 to 20 but most of the time around 10 and 11. The higher your ability score for an ability, the higher your [[#Ability Modifiers|Ability Modifier]] for that ability.
## Ability Score List
- Strength
- Dexterity
- Constitution
- Intelligence
- Wisdom
- Charisma
## Determining Ability Scores
- Your base ability scores are determined when you create your character, these base values rarely change. To determine your ability score beyond the base value, you do the following in order:
	1. Apply all effects that set your ability score to a constant number, most recent occurs last.
	2. Apply effects that add or subtract to your ability score.
	3. Apply [[Efficiency]] effects
## Ability Modifiers
- To find the ability modifier from an ability score, subtract 10 from the score and divide the difference by 2 (rounded down). The resulting quotient is the modifier. The following is a table which can be used to easily find the modifier for some common ability scores.

| Ability Score | Ability Modifier | Ability Score | Ability Modifier | Ability Score | Ability Modifier |
| ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- | ------------- | ---------------- |
| 1             | -5               | 10-11         | 0                | 20-21         | +5               |
| 2-3           | -4               | 12-13         | +1               | 22-23         | +6               |
| 4-5           | -3               | 14-15         | +2               | 24-25         | +7               |
| 6-7           | -2               | 16-17         | +3               | 26-27         | +8               |
| 8-9           | -1               | 18-19         | +4               | 28-29         | +9               |

## Ability Checks & Saving Throws
- You may be asked to perform an ability check or a saving throw when performing an action. Ability checks and saving throws all have an ability associated with them (Dexterity check, wisdom saving throw, etc.)
	- Ability checks are used to determine the outcome of an uncertain action on the roller's part.
	- Saving throws are used to determine the outcome of an uncertain situation that the roller is in.
- There are some core differences ability checks can be failed at will, can be backed out of before rolling, and may have an associated skill. Saving throws cannot be failed at will, cannot be backed out of, and are limited to abilities. 
- To perform an ability check or saving throw of these you do the following steps in order:
	1. Roll 1d20.
		- If you have advantage or disadvantage, roll the  relevant number of additional 20-sided-dice and take the highest or lowest result based off of if you had advantage or disadvantage.
	2. Add or subtract the relevant ability modifier.
		-  If you have a cybernetic that grants efficiency in the relevant skill, apply the efficiency to the relevant ability score, determine the modifier based off of that new score instead.
	3. Add any relevant skill proficiency or expertise.
	4. Add or subtract any modifiers from conditions.
	5. Add or subtract any modifiers from psycast effects.
	6. Apply any multiplying effects.
	7. Apply any dividing effects.
	8. Apply any percent effects.
- Most ability checks and saving throws will not have any modifiers beyond your ability modifier and skill proficiency bonus.
