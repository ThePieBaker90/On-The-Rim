When rolling to hit, the attacking creature's controller does the following in order:
1. Determine your roll to hit.
	1. Roll 1d20.
		- If you have advantage or disadvantage, roll the  relevant number of additional 20-sided-dice and take the highest or lowest result based off of if you had advantage or disadvantage.
		- If the result is a 20, you automatically hit and do all critical hit effects.
		- If the result is a 1, you automatically miss and do all critical miss effects.
	2. Add or subtract the relevant ability modifier.
	3. Add any relevant proficiency or expertise modifier.
	4. Add or subtract any modifiers from conditions.
	5. Add or subtract any modifiers from psycast effects.
	6. Apply any multiplying effects.
	7. Apply any dividing effects.
	8. Apply any percent effects.
2. Determine if you hit.
	1. Determine the effective [[Armor Class]] of the creature based on the [[Armor Piercing]] of the attack.
	2. Determine the effective [[Evade Class]] of the creature based on any relevant effects of the attack.
	3. Add the effective [[Armor Class]] and effective [[Evade Class]] together to get their [[Hit Class]], then compare it to the roll to hit.
		- The attack hits if the roll to hit is greater than or equal to the defending creature's [[Hit Class]].
		- The attack misses if the roll to hit is less than the defending creature's [[Hit Class]].
3. If the attack hit, proceed with the on hit effects, otherwise nothing happens.
