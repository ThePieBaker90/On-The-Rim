## Breathing Overview
- All creatures must breathe oxygen to stay healthy and alive.  A creature breathes automatically every 5 seconds, taking in 500mL of air with every breath.
## Holding your Breath
- A creature can hold its breath at any time for free, the maximum amount of time a creature can hold its breath for is its constitution ability score multiplied by 6 seconds. Holding their breath prevents the creature from taking in the surrounding air.
- When you first breathe after holding your breath, you cannot hold your breath again for the duration you held your breath before.
## Breathing Deprivation
- A creature who has not breathed oxygen for their maximum breath holding time falls [[Unconscious]] for 5 turns.
