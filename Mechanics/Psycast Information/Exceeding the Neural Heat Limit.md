Anytime you cast a psycast that would put you over your neural heat limit, you must roll on the cast effect table below. The effect happens at the same time the psycast is cast and cannot be interrupted or stopped without cancelling the psycast.

| 1d20 | Effect |
| ---- | ------ |
| 1    |        |
| 2    |        |
| 3    |        |
| 4    |        |
| 5    |        |
| 6    |        |
| 7    |        |
| 8    |        |
| 9    |        |
| 10   |        |
| 11   |        |
| 12   |        |
| 13   |        |
| 14   |        |
| 15   |        |
| 16   |        |
| 17   |        |
| 18   |        |
| 19   |        |
| 20   |        |

Additional effects apply to the roll depending on how much you exceed your limit by. For example, with a neural heat limit of 30, having 30 generated would be 100%, but having 60 generated would be 200%

| Percent of Neural Heat Limit  | Effects                                 |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 100% - 132% (Overloaded)      | No Effects                              |
| 133% - 165% (Very Overloaded) | Roll with disadvantage                  |
| 166% - 199% (Extreme)         | Reroll until the result is less than 10 |
| 200% + (Overwhelming)         | Guaranteed 1                            |
