Anytime you cast a psycast that would put you over your neural heat limit, you must roll on the cast effect table below. The effect happens at the same time the psycast is cast and cannot be interrupted or stopped without cancelling the psycast. Some effects trigger a "miscast", these miscasts come in 2 levels and can be found on the relevant path's document.

| 1d100    | Effect                                                                                             | % Chance |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| 1        | Caster gains the [[Psychic Stun]] condition for 1 hour                                             | 1%       |
| 2 - 3    | Caster gains the [[Psychic Stun]] condition for 5 turns                                            | 2%       |
| 4 - 6    | Caster gains the [[Psychic Stun]] condition for 3 turns                                            | 3%       |
| 7 - 10   | Caster gains the [[Psychic Stun]] condition for 1 turn                                             | 4%       |
| 11 - 25  | Level 2 Miscast of the same path as the original psycast.                                          | 15%      |
| 26 - 50  | Level 1 miscast of the same path as the original psycast.                                          | 25%      |
| 51 - 95  | No Effect                                                                                          | 45%      |
| 96 - 100 | [[Psycasts\|Psycast]] gets upcast to the first degree for free (if possible, otherwise no effect). | 5%       |

Additional effects apply to the roll depending on how much you exceed your limit by. For example, with a neural heat limit of 30, having 30 generated would be 100% of the limit, but having 60 generated would be 200% of the limit.

| Percent of Neural Heat Limit  | Effects                                                 |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| 100% - 132% (Overloaded)      | Roll Normally                                           |
| 133% - 165% (Very Overloaded) | Roll with disadvantage                                  |
| 166% - 199% (Extreme)         | Roll with disadvantage, result is halved (rounded down) |
| 200% + (Overwhelming)         | Guaranteed 1                                            |
