- Psycasts are the equivalent to spells and are how magic is done in this universe. Psycasts can only be cast by creatures with a [[NOR-1 My First Psylink|Psylink]] (called psycasters), be it installed, natural, or some other form. 
- There are two resources that are concerned with casting psycasts, [[Neural Heat]] and [[Psyfocus]]. Both are detailed in-depth in their own documents. 
- There are two stats that may be referenced by psycasts, psycasting ability modifier and the psycast save DC.
	- A creature's psycasting ability modifier is determined by their class.
	- A creature's psycast save DC is 8 + their proficiency bonus + their psycasting ability modifier. This may be referenced as the DC for saving throws among other things.
- All psycasts belong to a path, the following is a comprehensive list of paths:

	- Each path contains 10 psycasts of varying levels. To be able to learn a psycast from a path, you must know a lower level psycast from the same path. Level 1 is the lowest level for a psycast and has no prerequisites to learn. 
- Psycasts may be upcast for an additional cost specified in their description. The effects of upcasting are listed in each psycast's description.
	- This cost may be psyfocus, neural heat, or some other cost.
	- Upcasting a psycast one time is called a first degree upcast, upcasting it two times is called a second degree upcast, and so on.
- All psycasts require components listed in that psycast's description, the components are as follows: Kinetic, Gesture, Verbal, and Material
	- Kinetic components require the psycaster have one free hand.
		- Gesture components require the psycaster have two free hands.
	- Verbal components require the psycaster to be able to speak.
	- Material components require the psycaster have the materials within their inventory, these materials are not consumed unless explicitly stated. 
- Some psycasts may require concentration during the psycasts duration. Concentration may only be held on 1 psycast at a time. Concentration can be dispelled by the psycaster at anytime for free. 
	- While concentrating on some psycasts, your baseline [[Neural Heat]] may not drop below a specified amount. This amount is indicated in parenthesis next to the initial [[Neural Heat]] cost.
	- If you are hit while concentrating on a psycast you must make a saving throw to continue concentrating. The DC is equal to 10 or half the damage of the attack, whichever is higher. Your modifier for this roll is your psycasting modifier.
