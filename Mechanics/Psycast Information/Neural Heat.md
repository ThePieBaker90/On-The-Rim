Anytime you cast a psycast, it generates an amount of neural heat. Neural heat is the primary limiter of how many psycasts may be cast in a short amount of time. 

The base neural heat limit is 30. This limit may be increased or decreased by several factors. This limit is a soft limit and may be exceeded by psycasters, although there are certain risks. See [[Exceeding the Neural Heat Limit]] for more info.

Neural heat dissipates over rapidly over time, at a base rate of 5 per turn. This rate may be increased or decreased by several factors.
