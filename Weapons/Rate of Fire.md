ROF is expressed as a positive number which represents the number of attacks a weapon makes when an action is used.

“ROF is like a resource that you can accumulate and use but with limits. When you use an action, you gain the ROF with the weapon and can use it freely on that turn but any unused ROF >= 1 will be lost at the end of the turn. Additionally, ROF may only be used in increments of 1 (unless a weapon has an exception) and your ROF pool for a weapon may never become negative. ROF is on a per weapon basis, you can’t use an SMG then a shotgun and expect 6 shots with 2 actions.”

Examples include:
* ROF of 0.5: 1 attack is made when 2 actions are used (actions may be made on separate turns).
* ROF of 1: 1 attack is made when 1 action is used.
* ROF is 1.5: 1 attack is made when 1 action is used, every other action has an extra attack.
* ROF of 2: 2 attacks are made when 1 action is used.
