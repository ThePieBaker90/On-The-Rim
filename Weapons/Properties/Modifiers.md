Modifiers are optional properties a weapon may have, usually weapons will have only 1 premade modifier although there is no hard limit to the number of modifiers that may be on a weapon. Premade modifiers affect the weapons name, for example, a [[Revolver]] with the [[Frontier]] modifier would be called a "Frontier Revolver". Some modifiers can only be on certain weapons, if a modifier has restrictions they will be stated, otherwise the modifier may go on any ranged weapon base.
