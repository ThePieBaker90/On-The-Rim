A weapon that has the returning property will return to its userâ€™s hands after being thrown, dropped, or otherwise lost from the users hands. Items which return this way may only return in a straight line and will not navigate around walls (unless otherwise stated). If an item cannot reach its user due to a wall, it fails to return.
