A weapon with this property can only be used a certain number of times before running out of uses. The maximum number of times a weapon can be used is specified in the 1st option.

When a weapon is used, its stored ammunition decreases by one. Notably, a weapon may be used multiple times in one action if it has a high [[Rate of Fire]].

If a weapon has the ammunition property but no [[Reload]] property, it may not be reloaded and is discarded upon being fully used.
