Cybernetics replace body parts of living creatures in order to enhance their abilities beyond natural limits. They can also be installed to remedy missing limbs or organs.

Cybernetics are installed on creatures (called the patient) by another creature (called the installer) or themselves. If installed by another creature and the installer is a surgeon, the surgeon has advantage on a DC 13 medicine check to install the part.. If installed by another player and the installer is not a surgeon, the installer must make a DC 16 medicine check to install the part. If installed by the user, the patient must make a DC 17 medicine check and a DC 17 constitution check. If a medicine or constitution check fails, the body part is lost, and the patient must deal with the relevant penalties of having a body part removed

Cybernetics only take up one part slot (unless otherwise stated), for example; installing an archotech arm does not replace both arms, only one arm.
