The upper-body is made of 2 [[Shoulders]], 2 [[Hands]], and 2 [[Arms]]. All of these, rather than having their own [[Efficiency]], affect the upper-body efficiency. 

Total efficiency is calculated by taking an unweighted average between all upper-body parts.
* Ex: if a character has 1 archotech shoulder installed and 1 prosthetic hand installed they do the following calculation:

| Part                   | Efficiency of Part | Running Total |
| ---------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Archotech Shoulder     | 150%               | 150%          |
| Implied Archotech Arm  | 150%               | 300%          |
| Implied Archotech Hand | 150%               | 450%          |
| Natural Shoulder       | 100%               | 550%          |
| Natural Arm            | 100%               | 650%          |
| Prosthetic Hand        | 90%                | 740%          |


* We then take 740% and divide it by 6 to find the average, which gives us an overall upper-body efficiency of 123.33% which affects [[Upper-Body Strength and Dexterity]].
* This only affects Upper-Body Strength and Dexterity, if an upper-body part affects a different skill, that skill's efficiency bonus is calculated like a normal cybernetic's efficiency bonus.
