* Necessary to live:
	* No.
* [[Efficiency]] Effects:
	* +[[Sight-Based Perception]]
* Cost Multiplier:
	* x1.1
* [[Cybercost]] Multiplier:
	* x1
* Nonexistent Versions:
	* None.
* Additional Info:
	* The total sight-based perception effect is the average between the eye's efficiencies with the most powerful eye being at a 300% weight and the least powerful eye has 100% weight
	* Ex: one eye is bionic and one eye is gone, the bionic eye is the strongest and has an efficiency of 110% and the removed eye is the least powerful and has an efficiency of 0%. 110% is multiplied by 3.00 (300% base value) to get 330%, then 0% is added to 330%. The result is 330% which is then divided by 4 to get 82.5% overall efficiency.
