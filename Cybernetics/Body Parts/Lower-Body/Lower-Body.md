The Lower-Body is made of 2 [[Feet]], 2 [[Legs]], and 1 [[Pelvis]]. All of these, rather than having their own [[Efficiency]], affect the lower-body efficiency. 

Total efficiency is calculated by taking an unweighted average between all lower-body parts.
* Ex: if a character has 1 bionic leg installed and 1 archotech foot installed they do the following calculation:

| Part                | Efficiency of Part | Running Total |
| ------------------- | ------------------ | ------------- |
| Bionic Leg          | 110%               | 110%          |
| Implied Bionic Foot | 110%               | 220%          |
| Natural Leg         | 100%               | 320%          |
| Archotech Foot      | 150%               | 470%          |
| Natural Pelvis      | 100%               | 570%          |
* We then take 570% and divide it by 5 to find the average, which gives us an overall lower-body efficiency of 114% which affects [[Lower-Body Strength and Dexterity]].
* This only affects Lower-Body Strength and Dexterity, if a lower-body part affects a different skill, that skill's efficiency bonus is calculated like a normal cybernetic's efficiency bonus.
