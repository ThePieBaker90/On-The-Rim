- All cybernetics have a “cybercost” associated with them. The sum of all [[Cybernetics]]’ cybercost may not exceed the character’s base (non-cybernetic affected) CON ability score + their level. If it were to, the character may go [[Cyberpsycho]] during certain times. 
- Cybercost is a float which is rounded to 2 decimal places.
- Cybernetics will have a cybercost multiplier associated with them. 
	- Cybercost multiplier does not affect special cybernetics.
	- Implied parts do not have their cybercost multiplier factored into the part they come with (ex: The [[Arms]] cybercost multiplier does not include the [[Hands]] cybercost multiplier).
